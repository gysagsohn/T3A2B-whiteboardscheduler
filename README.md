# T3A2B-whiteboardscheduler


The plan for this repository is to create the backend of my application here.

I have added another file to this repository called T3A2A, that contains all of the Part A of this assignment and the planning for it. 

For this assignment I am using Kanaban Board with Story Points to manage the application. I will upload the screen shot of the trello board here, but it will contain both the backend and front end stuff.

Front End repository can be found:

(Insert link once done)


Plan:

## Database
Mongoose DB
- local Mongoose until it is finished
- after all of the functions are finished then it will be uplaoded to use MongoDB Atlas Database

## Models
- User
- Asset
- Operator
- Client
- Allocation

## Route
Each Model will have it own route
- User
- Asset
- Operator
- Client
- Allocation

## Repository Management
To ensure that all code is tested and functional three branches have been made:
- Main 
- Testing
- Coding

### Main
This is the finished product that can be released

### Testing
This is where the code will go once it is out of production and need to be tested before it is published. For testing I am planning on doing a combination of 2, manual testing and Github testing. For the end point of the API they will be done manual testing to make sure they are working 

## Coding
This is the production branch where I will be working on the code. It will only be pushed to the testing branch once I believe the code is ready to be published

## Packaged/Library
- npm (node package manager) 
- express
- mongoose
- nodemon (DEV)
